<h1>Creating an Active Directory Domain</h1>
In this tutorial, we create an Active Directory Domain joinging a Windows client to the Domain.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Virtual Network inside Azure Resource Group
- Powershell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 Pro (22H2)-Client 1
- Windows Server- DC-1(Domain Controller)

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

</p>

<p>
Create a Resource Group, as seen [here](https://github.com/gustygreen/Azure). Create and add a Virtual Network. Create and add the Domain Controller. Create and add the Client.<br />
<p>

<h2> Create a Virtual Network</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c93cd1b-c8c3-4828-855b-b748dc9b76a2" height="80%" width="80%"/>

Add the Virtual Network to the Resource Group. Name it. Verify it's in the same Region as the Resource Group. Review and Create.
</p>
 
<h2> Create the Domain Controller(DC-1)</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64617047-3cfb-46e7-bf73-2bf80954640f" height="50%" width="50%"/>

Create a new Virtual Machine for the Domain Controller. Name it(1). Verify it's in the correct Resource Group(2). Verify it's in the same Region as the Resource Group(3). Make sure that the Image is Windows Server 2022 DataCenter(4).
</p>

Verify that the Server has a decent size 2vncpus and 8Gb is fine. Add a user and password. Select Next:Disks

Place the Server in the Active-Directory-VNet. Review and Create
</p>

When Azure has completed Verifying, Select Create. This will create the new Domain Controller in our Resource Groups Virtual Network.

<h2> Create the Client(Client-1)</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22d1b2cf-00a8-4ff4-8ffd-b597048afe96" height="50%" width="50%"/>

We will go through the same process as creating the Domain Controller except that for the Image we will use Windows 10 Pro(22H2). We will name the VM client-1.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/555378f6-55e1-4790-91e0-9e838e436ade" height="50%" width="50%"/>

We verify that the size of the image is good, give it a user, password, and check the Licensing. Review and Create
</p>

When Azure has completed Verifying, Select Create. This will create the new Client in our Resource Groups Virtual Network.

Our Resource Group is now setup with a Virtual Network, Domain Controller, and Client.

<h2>Set DC-1 to have Static IP address</h2>
This is to prevent Azure from resetting the Private IP address if the server is turned off. We are using the DC as a DNS server.

In Azure go to the DC-1 VM-Networking-Network settings-Configure the virtual NIC.
